# Advanced data journalism: Powerful data reporting and mapping tools

Welcome!

This is _your_ copy of the code for this class. In one of the introductory videos, you'll learn how to keep this copy in your own Github account and run it in a "computer in the cloud" called a "codespace."

You'll also learn about starting and stopping your codespace, which I'm also going to note here for your reference later:

**When you're done for the day ...**

- Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Click on the three dots in the row for "My class codespace"
- Click "Stop codespace"

**Returning to work**

- Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Click _right on the title:_ "My class codespace"
